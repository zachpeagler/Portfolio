## US State Family Farm Products

An Rshiny app using the tidyverse, sf, and data from localharvest and tigris (us census data). It displays a map of the US with each state filled in relative to the number of farms that produce a certain item. There are inputs for product type, palette choice, season, facet wrapping by season, and 
It also _will have_ a histogram of the top producers from a single state and a slider that allows the user to select a minimum and maximum *last updated* range, which corresponds to how recently the farm's localharvest.org page was updated.

The data for this was collectd ethically in accordance with localharvest.org's privacy policy and contains no personal information.
