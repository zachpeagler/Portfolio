# Description
This was created for day 5 of my App A Day series!

For day 4 I created an app looking at the most popular baby names by year and gender as a bar plot. I also added a scatter plot showing the change in a name's popularity over time.

The data for this can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-data). This example data contains *all* the registered names in the United States with more than 5 occurrences since 1880. It was last updated on March 3, 2024.
